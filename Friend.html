					<h2> Poem for afriend</h2>
					<p> <pre>
						 Friends that are loyal are always there to make you laugh when you are down, 
						 They are not afraid to help you avoid mistakes 
						 And they look out for your best interest. 
						 This kind of friend can be hard to find, 
						 But they offer a friendship that will last a lifetime.
						 Other frieds are family </pre>
